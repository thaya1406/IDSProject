> Data Storytelling

-   According to the [nugit.co website](https://www.nugit.co/what-is-data-storytelling/), data storytelling is a methodology for communicating information, tailored to a specific audience, with a compelling narrative.  

-   We believe that data in the form of rows and columns won't relay insights for decision-making effectively. In data storytelling, we would like to convey meaningful information our data holds that could make a groundbreaking difference to the audience.   

-   Therefore, our group proposed a **dashboard** that consists of numerous visualization for stakeholders, specifically, brand and business owners as well as marketing executives to analyse the public's sentiment (Twitter) about their products. 

Our **dashboard** contains:  
+ Sentiment Analysis through Positive or Negative Tweets ratio, Number of total Tweets, Wordcloud, Summary of Sentiments, Top Positive and Negative Words and Types of Sentiment Found.

+ Overview Tweets where the tweets are believe to be found and a table of Tweets that smartly analyses whether it is considered as a positive or negative tweet.

+ Number of Tweets in terms of per hour, per day and per week to indicate how relevant your brand or product is throughout a period of time.

+ High Scores where you'll be introduced with your brand's top tweeters, top hashtags, top words and top emojis.

+ Tweet Wall, your awesome companion that graphically tells your clients' or followers'tweets about you.

> Choice of Data (Datasets)
-   Since the visualization of our data supposed to be at real-time where new tweets are flooding in, we will be accessing the Twitter API through its specific keys and secrets.  

-   The Twitter API can be used to programmatically retrieve and analyze Twitter data, as well as build for the conversation on Twitter.  

-   Why we thought that Twitter API is the best choice of data for this project is because majority of the community leverages this social media to express their opinions, sentiments, views or arguments regarding a certain topic. According to the company's Q3 2020 report, 187 million people use the platform daily and 330 million use it at least once a month.  

-   The Twitter API lets you read and write Twitter data. Thus, you can use it to compose tweets, read profiles, and access your followersâ€™ data and a high volume of tweets on particular subjects in specific locations.  

-   Twitter API contains several features including four main objects (Tweets, Entities, Places, and Users), daily restrictions: calls and changes in the API are restricted by access tokens to protect the platform from abuse, tt is based on HTTP (rather than SSL) and there are specific measures to adapt the API operation to the social network including library restrictions, generated paging, and specific parameters.

### **Our Precious Experience**

-   It was a new experience as we had never done an actual proper ShinyApp before thus we did run into some problems initially.

-   We had some problems during our coding but all was resolved as we realized it was some syntax error

***Overall it have been such a valuable experience completing this application on ShinyApps, and also providing us chance to expand our knowledges and skills on data science for future purposes***
