> Data Storytelling

-   According to the [nugit.co website](https://www.nugit.co/what-is-data-storytelling/), data storytelling is a methodology for communicating information, tailored to a specific audience, with a compelling narrative.  

-   We believe that data in the form of rows and columns won't relay insights for decision-making effectively. In data storytelling, we would like to convey meaningful information our data holds that could make a groundbreaking difference to the audience.   

-   Therefore, our group proposed a **dashboard** that consists of numerous visualization for stakeholders, specifically, brand and business owners as well as marketing executives to analyse the public's sentiment (Twitter) about their products. 

-   Our **dashboard** contains:  
    + Sentiment Analysis through Positive or Negative Tweets ratio, Number of total Tweets, Wordcloud, Summary of Sentiments, Top Positive and Negative Words and Types of Sentiment Found. <img src="https://github.com/thaya1406/IDSProject/blob/master/Slides%20Presentation/Data%20Story%20Sentiment.jpg" alt="" width="800" align="center"/>  
    + Overview Tweets where the tweets are believe to be found and a table of Tweets that smartly analyses whether it is considered as a positive or negative tweet. ![](https://github.com/thaya1406/IDSProject/blob/master/Slides%20Presentation/Data%20Story%20Map%20and%20Table%20Tweet.jpg)  
    + Number of Tweets in terms of per hour, per day and per week to indicate how relevant your brand or product is throughout a period of time. ![](https://github.com/thaya1406/IDSProject/blob/master/Slides%20Presentation/Data%20Story%20Number%20of%20Scores.jpg)  
    + High Scores where you'll be introduced with your brand's top tweeters, top hashtags, top words and top emojis. ![](https://github.com/thaya1406/IDSProject/blob/master/Slides%20Presentation/Data%20Story%20High%20Scores.jpg)

### **Our Precious Experience**

-   It was a new experience as we had never done an actual proper ShinyApp before thus we did run into some problems initially.

-   We had some problems during our coding but all was resolved as we realized it was some syntax error

***Overall it have been such a valuable experience completing this application on ShinyApps, and also providing us chance to expand our knowledges and skills on data science for future purposes***
