library(gathertweet) ##Need to download thru his repository not thru the install.packages thingy
gathertweet_search("najib") ##You change this term, I don't know how to 'connect' it with the input textbox :(

## THINGS TO TAKE NOTE
## Set the working directory to data/ because when you run the gathertweet_search("   ") line, it'll produce a tweets.rds file needed for the Tweet Wall
